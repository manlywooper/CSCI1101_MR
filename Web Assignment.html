        <p>There's nothing on the right side of the screen cause I don't know how to put stuff there. <br> 
        And the reason why everything is in black and white is because I don't like bright colors, <br> 
        since they hurt my eyes and I figured it would hurt yours too. </p>

<h3> Horror Movie Villains I could beat in a fight </h3>
        <ol>
            <li> John Kramer (Buddy is 98 years old) </li>
            <li> Children of the Corn (LITERALLY KIDS) </li>
            <li> Chucky (Literally two feet in height) </li>
            <li> Ghostface (Do literally anything cause they are human) </li>
            <li> Pennywise (Just dont be scared) </li>
        </ol>
<h3> Further Reasoning to list above </h3>

        <tr>
            <td>Again, he is literally an old man dying from cancer. As long as I don't black out and get stuck in one of his traps I win.</td>
            <td>I may lose if there is like 20+, otherwise I am not losing to literal 1st graders. </td>
            <td>He is a doll that has human characteristics, meaning he can bleed and therefore can die.</td>
            <td>Depends on the iteration, but they are still one of the clumsiest horror villains to exist. Just step on their stupid cloak and they'll fall over.</td>
            <td>Has a variety of scary abilities but got defeated twice after some morale buffs. Can lose to a pencil if you believe its a missile. </td>

            <h2> CONGRATULATIONS! YOU'VE REACHED THE END </h6>
            <p> Thank you for checking out my short and simple site. I wanted to add more images but I figured that would <br> 
                mess up the layout of everything and I could not really get things to fit properly. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kBq_IZYhDg" target="_blank"> Sad. </a> <br> 
                I look forward to creating more projects in the future!
            </p>
